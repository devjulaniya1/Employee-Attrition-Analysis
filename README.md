# üìà Employee Attrition Analysis (Excel Project)

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of employee attrition, executed entirely using **Microsoft Excel**. The primary goal was to move beyond simply calculating turnover to identify the specific demographic, performance, and temporal factors driving employee departures. The findings result in **actionable intelligence** designed to help HR professionals and management implement targeted, cost-saving retention strategies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology: The Excel Workflow

The analysis utilized advanced Excel features (Pivot Tables, Slicers, conditional logic) to structure a robust and auditable workflow:

1.  **Data Preparation & Feature Engineering:**
    * Handled missing values and standardized column names.
    * Created crucial derived metrics: **Employee Tenure (Years)**, **Performance Groupings** (High, Medium, Low), and **Attrition Status** (Voluntary vs. Involuntary).
2.  **Core Analysis:** Used **Pivot Tables** to calculate the overall attrition rate and segmented it across key variables: Job Role, Tenure Group, Age, and Performance Rating.
3.  **Visualization & Dashboard:** Built an integrated **Dashboard** featuring line graphs for time trends and bar charts for demographic breakdowns, allowing for interactive exploration using **Slicers**.

## üéØ Key Findings & Actionable Recommendations

The analysis identified three high-impact areas where retention efforts should be focused:

### 1. The Onboarding & Role Crisis

* **Observation:** Attrition is critically high in the **Laboratory Technician** role (in R&D) and among employees with **less than 2 years of tenure**.
* **Recommendation:** Implement **Targeted 'Stay Interviews'** for employees in their first 18 months, especially for high-risk roles, to proactively address workload, support, and initial career alignment.

### 2. Performance and Voluntary Push

* **Observation:** The majority of attrition ($\text{[INSERT YOUR ACTUAL PERCENTAGE, e.g., 85\%]}$) is **Voluntary**. The highest rate of departure is found among **Medium Performers**, primarily citing **lack of career growth** and **compensation**.
* **Recommendation:** Focus retention efforts on the core workforce by creating clear, documented **internal promotion pathways** specifically for the Medium Performer group.

### 3. The Seasonal Exit Trigger

* **Observation:** Attrition consistently spikes every year in **Q1 (March/April)**, indicating employees are using their annual bonus/review as a window to resign.
* **Recommendation:** **Redesign the Review Cycle.** Shift the timing of performance reviews and salary adjustments for high-turnover departments to a **mid-year cycle (Q3)**. This secures the employee's commitment for the next year *before* the Q1 attrition wave.
